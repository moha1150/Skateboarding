## Skateboarding

This website is a platform for showcasing and celebrating skateboarding, with links to various pages featuring videos, photos, and skateboarding apparel, as well as social media profiles and a carousel with images of skateboarding.


I created this website to showcase my love for skateboarding. The website includes links to various pages and features, such as a home page, videos, photos, and a dropdown menu for "Drip," which is a line of skateboarding apparel that I offer. I also included a carousel with images of skateboarding to give visitors a taste of the excitement and thrill of the sport. Additionally, I included links to my social media profiles so that visitors can follow me and stay up to date on my skateboarding adventures. I designed the website using the Bootstrap framework and incorporated some icons from Font Awesome. I hope that visitors will enjoy the website and find it helpful or inspiring.
